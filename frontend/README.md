# HAV frontend projects

This folder holds the frontend parts of the HAV.

## CMS

The cms parts of the HAV are built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

```
cd cms
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Note that you will need the django server running in order to get results.

## Admin UI

```
cd admin
yarn install && yarn hmr
```

## UI

This will be the basis of a a shared ui library.
Very early state, use at your own risk.

## Gatsby CMS _deprecated_

This experiment was quite advanced and we will keep it around for now. Mainly for historic reasons.
