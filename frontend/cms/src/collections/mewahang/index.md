This HAV thematical focus collection is based on fieldword among the Mewahang Rai of the Arun Valley (Sankhuwa Sabha district, Nepal) carried out by Martin Gaenszle mainly in 1984â€“85. Additional fieldwork was carried out intermittently in the following years until 1996. The photographs and sound recordings document the largely traditional way of live of a Rai community situated in what later became the Makalu-Barun National Park. It reflects a time shortly before and at the beginning of accelerating social changes in the wake of the democracy movement of 1990. In particular the collection records a lively religious tradition of ritual performances (known as the muddum). The corpus includes life-cycle rituals (weddings, funerals, but also, equally important as weddings: house inaugurations), shamanic rituals, healing ceremonies and, above all, the complex cycle of harvest rituals performed at the end of the agricultural year.
