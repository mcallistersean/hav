        The HAV is a modern multimedia archive at the Center for Inter­disciplinary Research and Documentation of Inner
        and South Asian Cultural History (CIRDIS), University of Vienna, and home to research documentation from South
        and Central Asia with a special focus on the Himalaya.

        Its over-arching archive structure houses multi-disciplinary data originating from largely third-party funded
        research projects as well as private collections or donations. It aims to provide a strong foundation for the
        successful collaboration between research partners from various disciplines united by a common interest and wish
        to preserve and share their data according to the policies of the open science community.
