# Welcome to the Himalaya Archive Vienna

The HAV is a modern multimedia archive at the Center for Inter­disciplinary 
Research and Documentation of Inner and South Asian Cultural History (CIRDIS), 
University of Vienna, and home to research documentation from South and Central 
Asia with a special focus on the Himalaya.

Its over-arching archive structure houses multi-disciplinary data originating 
from largely third-party funded research projects as well as private collections 
or donations. It aims to provide a strong foundation for the successful 
collaboration between research partners from various disciplines united 
by a common interest and wish to preserve and share their data according 
to the policies of the open science community.

Further information about us, our ongoing research initiatives and 
related news can be found on the website of the Center for 
Inter­disciplinary Research and Documentation of Inner and South 
Asian Cultural History (CIRDIS).
